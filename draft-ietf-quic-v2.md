--- abstract

This document specifies QUIC version 2, which is identical to QUIC version 1
except for some trivial details. Its purpose is to combat various ossification
vectors and exercise the version negotiation framework. It also serves as a
template for the minimum changes in any future version of QUIC.

Note that "version 2" is an informal name for this proposal that indicates it
is the second standards-track QUIC version. The protocol specified here will
receive a version number other than 2 from IANA.

Discussion of this work is encouraged to happen on the QUIC IETF
mailing list [](quic@ietf.org) or on the GitHub repository which
contains the draft:
[](https://github.com/quicwg/quic-v2).

# Introduction

QUIC {{QUIC}} has numerous extension points, including the version number
that occupies the second through fifth bytes of every long header (see
{{?QUIC-INVARIANTS=RFC8999}}). If experimental versions are rare, and QUIC
version 1 constitutes the vast majority of QUIC traffic, there is the potential
for middleboxes to ossify on the version bytes always being 0x00000001.

In QUIC version 1, Initial packets are encrypted with the version-specific salt
as described in {{Section 5.2 of QUIC-TLS}}. Protecting Initial packets in this
way allows observers to inspect their contents, which includes the TLS Client
Hello or Server Hello messages. Again, there is the potential for middleboxes to
ossify on the version 1 key derivation and packet formats.

Finally {{!QUIC-VN=I-D.ietf-quic-version-negotiation}} provides two mechanisms
for endpoints to negotiate the QUIC version to use. The "incompatible" version
negotiation method can support switching from any QUIC version to any
other version with full generality, at the cost of an additional round-trip at
the start of the connection. "Compatible" version negotiation eliminates the
round-trip penalty but levies some restrictions on how much the two versions can
differ semantically.

QUIC version 2 is meant to mitigate ossification concerns and exercise the
version negotiation mechanisms. The only change is a tweak to key derivation
inputs to enforce full key separation. Any endpoint that supports two versions
needs to implement version negotiation to protect against downgrade attacks.

# Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Differences with QUIC Version 1

QUIC version 2 endpoints MUST implement the QUIC version 1 specification as
described in {{QUIC}}, {{QUIC-TLS}}, and {{!RFC9002}}. However, the following
differences apply in version 2.

## Version Field

The Version field of long headers is 0x709a50c4.

## Long Header Packet Types

All version 2 long header packet types are different. The Type field values are:

* Initial: 0b01
* 0-RTT: 0b10
* Handshake: 0b11
* Retry: 0b00

## Cryptography changes

### Initial Salt

The salt used to derive Initial keys in {{Section 5.2 of QUIC-TLS}} changes to:

~~~
initial_salt = 0xa707c203a59b47184a1d62ca570406ea7ae3e5d3
~~~

### HKDF Labels

The labels used in {{QUIC-TLS}} to derive packet protection keys (Section
{{Section 5.1 of QUIC-TLS}}{:sectionFormat="bare"}), header protection keys
(Section {{Section 5.4 of QUIC-TLS}}{:sectionFormat="bare"}), Retry Integrity
Tag keys (Section {{Section 5.8 of QUIC-TLS}}{:sectionFormat="bare"}), and key
updates (Section {{Section 6.1 of QUIC-TLS}}{:sectionFormat="bare"}) change from
"quic key" to "quicv2 key", from "quic iv" to "quicv2 iv", from "quic hp" to
"quicv2 hp", and from "quic ku" to "quicv2 ku", to meet the guidance for new
versions in Section {{Section 9.6 of QUIC-TLS}}{:sectionFormat="bare"} of that
document.

### Retry Integrity Tag

The key and nonce used for the Retry Integrity Tag ({{Section 5.8 of QUIC-TLS}})
change to:

~~~
secret =
  0x3425c20cf88779df2ff71e8abfa78249891e763bbed2f13c048343d348c060e2
key = 0xba858dc7b43de5dbf87617ff4ab253db
nonce = 0x141b99c239b03e785d6a2e9f
~~~


# Version Negotiation Considerations

QUIC version 2 is not intended to deprecate version 1. Endpoints that support
version 2 might continue support for version 1 to maximize compatibility with
other endpoints. In particular, HTTP clients often use Alt-Svc {{?RFC7838}} to
discover QUIC support. As this mechanism does not currently distinguish between
QUIC versions, HTTP servers that support multiple versions reduce the
probability of incompatibility and the cost associated with QUIC version
negotiation or TCP fallback. For example, an origin advertising support for "h3"
in Alt-Svc SHOULD support QUIC version 1 as it was the original QUIC version
used by HTTP/3 and therefore some clients will only support that version.

Any QUIC endpoint that supports QUIC version 2 MUST send, process, and validate
the version_information transport parameter specified in {{QUIC-VN}} to prevent
version downgrade attacks.

Note that version 2 meets that document's definition of a compatible version
with version 1, and version 1 is compatible with version 2. Therefore, servers
can use compatible negotiation to switch a connection between the two versions.
Endpoints that support both versions SHOULD support compatible version
negotiation to avoid a round trip.

## Compatible Negotiation Requirements

Compatible version negotiation between versions 1 and 2 follow the same
requirements in either direction. This section uses the terms "original
version" and "negotiated version" from {{QUIC-VN}}.

If the server sends a Retry packet, it MUST use the original version. The
client ignores Retry packets using other versions. The client MUST NOT use a
different version in the subsequent Initial that contains the Retry token. The
server MAY encode the QUIC version in its Retry token to validate that the
client did not switch versions, and drop the packet if it switched.

QUIC version 2 uses the same transport parameters to authenticate the Retry as
QUIC version 1. After switching to a negotiated version after a Retry, the
server MUST include the relevant transport parameters to validate that the
server sent the Retry and the connection IDs used in the exchange, as described
in {{Section 7.3 of QUIC}}. Note that the version of the first Initial and the
subsequent Retry are not authenticated by transport parameters.

The server SHOULD start sending its Initial packets using the negotiated
version as soon as it decides to change. Before the server is able to process
transport parameters from the client, it might need to respond to Initial
packets from the client. For these packets the server uses the original version.

Once the client has processed a packet using the negotiated version, it SHOULD
send subsequent Initial packets using that version. The server MUST NOT discard
its original version Initial receive keys until it successfully processes a
packet with the negotiated version.

Both endpoints MUST send Handshake or 1-RTT packets using the negotiated
version. An endpoint MUST drop packets using any other version. Endpoints have
no need to generate the keying material that would allow them to decrypt or
authenticate these packets.

If the server's version_information transport parameter does not contain a
Chosen Version field equivalent to the version in the server's Handshake packet
headers, the client MUST terminate the connection with a
VERSION_NEGOTIATION_ERROR.

The client MUST NOT send 0-RTT packets using the negotiated version, even after
processing a packet of that version from the server. Servers can apply original
version 0-RTT packets to a connection without additional considerations.

# TLS Resumption and NEW_TOKEN Tokens

TLS session tickets and NEW_TOKEN tokens are specific to the QUIC version of the
connection that provided them. Clients SHOULD NOT use a session ticket or token
from a QUIC version 1 connection to initiate a QUIC version 2 connection, or vice
versa.

Servers MUST validate the originating version of any session ticket or token and
not accept one issued from a different version. A rejected ticket results in
falling back to a full TLS handshake, without 0-RTT. A rejected token results in
the client address remaining unverified, which limits the amount of data the
server can send.

After compatible version negotiation, any resulting session ticket
maps to the negotiated version rather than original one.

# Ossification Considerations

QUIC version 2 provides protection against some forms of ossification. Devices
that assume that all long headers will encode version 1, or that the version 1
Initial key derivation formula will remain version-invariant, will not correctly
process version 2 packets.

However, many middleboxes such as firewalls focus on the first packet in a
connection, which will often remain in the version 1 format due to the
considerations above.

Clients interested in combating firewall ossification can initiate a connection
using version 2 if they are either reasonably certain the server supports it, or
are willing to suffer a round-trip penalty if they are incorrect.  In
particular, a server that issues a session ticket for version 2 indicates an
intent to maintain version 2 support while the ticket remains valid, even if
support cannot be guaranteed.

# Applicability {#applicability}

This version of QUIC provides no change from QUIC version 1 relating to the
capabilities available to applications. Therefore, all Application Layer
Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) ({{?RFC7301}}) codepoints specified to operate over
QUIC version 1 can also operate over this version of QUIC. In particular, both
the "h3" {{?I-D.ietf-quic-http}} and "doq" {{?I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsoquic}} ALPNs
can operate over QUIC version 2.

Unless otherwise stated, all QUIC extensions defined to work with version 1 also
work with version 2.

# Security Considerations

QUIC version 2 introduces no changes to the security or privacy properties of
QUIC version 1.

The mandatory version negotiation mechanism guards against downgrade attacks,
but downgrades have no security implications, as the version properties are
identical.

# IANA Considerations

This document requests that IANA add the following entry to the QUIC version
registry:

Value: 0x709a50c4

Status: provisional

Specification: This Document

# Sample Packet Protection {#test-vectors}

This section shows examples of packet protection so that implementations can be
verified incrementally. Samples of Initial packets from both client and server
plus a Retry packet are defined. These packets use an 8-byte client-chosen
Destination Connection ID of 0x8394c8f03e515708. Some intermediate values are
included. All values are shown in hexadecimal.


## Keys

The labels generated during the execution of the HKDF-Expand-Label function
(that is, HkdfLabel.label) and part of the value given to the HKDF-Expand
function in order to produce its output are:

client in:  00200f746c73313320636c69656e7420696e00

server in:  00200f746c7331332073657276657220696e00

quicv2 hp:  00100f746c7331332071756963763220687000

The initial secret is common:

~~~
initial_secret = HKDF-Extract(initial_salt, cid)
    = ddfcb7b82a430b7845210ad64b406977
      ed51b269a14bc69aa9ea9b366fa3b06b
~~~

The secrets for protecting client packets are:

~~~
client_initial_secret
    = HKDF-Expand-Label(initial_secret, "client in", "", 32)
    = 9fe72e1452e91f551b770005054034e4

    = 091efb735702447d07908f6501845794
~~~

The secrets for protecting server packets are:

~~~
server_initial_secret
    = HKDF-Expand-Label(initial_secret, "server in", "", 32)
    = 3c9bf6a9c1c8c71819876967bd8b979e

## Client Initial {#sample-client-initial}

The client sends an Initial packet.  The unprotected payload of this packet
contains the following CRYPTO frame, plus enough PADDING frames to make a
1162-byte payload:

~~~
060040f1010000ed0303ebf8fa56f129 39b9584a3896472ec40bb863cfd3e868

75300901100f088394c8f03e51570806 048000ffff
~~~

The unprotected header indicates a length of 1182 bytes: the 4-byte packet
number, 1162 bytes of frames, and the 16-byte authentication tag.  The header
includes the connection ID and a packet number of 2:

~~~
d3709a50c4088394c8f03e5157080000449e00000002
~~~

Protecting the payload produces output that is sampled for header protection.
Because the header uses a 4-byte packet number encoding, the first 16 bytes of
the protected payload is sampled and then applied to the header as follows:

~~~
sample = 23b8e610589c83c92d0e97eb7a6e5003

mask = AES-ECB(hp, sample)[0..4]
     = 8e4391d84a

header[0] ^= mask[0] & 0x0f
     = dd
header[18..21] ^= mask[1..4]
     = 4391d848
header = dd709a50c4088394c8f03e5157080000449e4391d848
~~~

The resulting protected packet is:

~~~
dd709a50c4088394c8f03e5157080000 449e4391d84823b8e610589c83c92d0e

## Server Initial

The server sends the following payload in response, including an ACK frame, a
CRYPTO frame, and no PADDING frames:

~~~
02000000000600405a020000560303ee fce7f7b37ba1d1632e96677825ddf739

020304
~~~

The header from the server includes a new connection ID and a 2-byte packet
number encoding for a packet number of 1:

~~~
d1709a50c40008f067a5502a4262b50040750001
~~~

As a result, after protection, the header protection sample is taken starting
from the third protected byte:

~~~
sample = ebb7972fdce59d50e7e49ff2a7e8de76
mask   = 41103f438e
header = d0709a50c40008f067a5502a4262b5004075103e
~~~

The final protected packet is then:

~~~
d0709a50c40008f067a5502a4262b500 4075103e63b4ebb7972fdce59d50e7e4

~~~


## Retry

This shows a Retry packet that might be sent in response to the Initial packet
in {{sample-client-initial}}. The integrity check includes the client-chosen
connection ID value of 0x8394c8f03e515708, but that value is not
included in the final Retry packet:

## ChaCha20-Poly1305 Short Header Packet

This example shows some of the steps required to protect a packet with
a short header.  This example uses AEAD_CHACHA20_POLY1305.

In this example, TLS produces an application write secret from which a server
uses HKDF-Expand-Label to produce four values: a key, an IV, a header
protection key, and the secret that will be used after keys are updated (this
last value is not used further in this example).

The following shows the steps involved in protecting a minimal packet with an
empty Destination Connection ID. This packet contains a single PING frame (that
is, a payload of just 0x01) and has a packet number of 654360564. In this
example, using a packet number of length 3 (that is, 49140 is encoded) avoids
having to pad the payload of the packet; PADDING frames would be needed if the
packet number is encoded on fewer bytes.

~~~
pn                 = 654360564 (decimal)
nonce              = a6b5bc6ab7dafce328ff4a29
unprotected header = 4200bff4
payload plaintext  = 01
payload ciphertext = 0ae7b6b932bc27d786f4bc2bb20f2162ba
~~~

The resulting ciphertext is the minimum size possible. One byte is skipped to
produce the sample for header protection.

~~~
sample = e7b6b932bc27d786f4bc2bb20f2162ba
mask   = 97580e32bf
header = 5558b1c6
~~~

The protected packet is the smallest possible packet size of 21 bytes.

packet = 5558b1c60ae7b6b932bc27d786f4bc2bb20f2162ba
